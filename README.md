# AngularPrimengApp

🚀 Building Dynamic UI with Angular, PrimeNG, and JSON Server 🚀


Here’s a quick breakdown of what went into this project:

💡 Angular Framework: Built the app's core with Angular, ensuring modularity, scalability, and performance.

🎨 PrimeNG: Used PrimeNG for its ready-to-use and customizable components, making the UI visually appealing and responsive without reinventing the wheel.

🔐 Custom Validators: Designed custom form validators to add specific, user-friendly checks and balances within forms, ensuring a smooth and reliable interaction.

🌐 JSON Server: Set up a JSON Server as a mock backend, streamlining the development process by providing a lightweight and quick REST API setup. This allowed me to focus on the UI without needing a full backend setup.

This project gave me valuable insights into enhancing user experience and creating efficient, testable front-end code. 🚀 If you’re working on Angular projects and need tips on validators or quick backend setups, feel free to reach out!
